# Python_exercises

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey building strong Python fundamentals.
It contains structured exercises, experiments, and practice files focused on understanding core programming concepts deeply.

### The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:

* Clear understanding of Python basics

* Practical experimentation

* Ability to test edge cases and explore “why” things work

### What I Practiced
This repo includes exercises on:

* File handling (open(), with, read(), seek())

* Understanding file cursors and memory behavior

* Working with text files

* Functions and reusable logic

* Iterators and built-in tools

* Structured problem-solving

### I intentionally experiment with:
* Professional level opening and reading files using the with statement
  
* Multiple reads from files
  
* Cursor movement behavior

* Different execution patterns (same cell vs different cell in Jupyter)

* Edge cases and error scenarios

## Repository Structure

* Reading_files.ipynb → File handling experiments and notebook-based learning

* Tasks.py → Python practice exercises

* hometasks.py → Independent practice problems

* sample1.txt, sample2.txt, sample3.txt → Test files used for file I/O experiments

## Next Steps

I am currently expanding into:

* More structured projects

* Data manipulation

* Writing cleaner, production-style Python

* Version control best practices
